**Fitness Program UI - Playbook Studio**

This project is a fitness program builder web application designed to help users create and view workout programs in a structured format. The application allows users to navigate through different workout days (e.g., Upper Body, Lower Body, Core, Full Body) and see detailed exercise plans with sets, reps, weights, and more.

_ Features_

- Multi-Day Workout Program: Organizes exercises by days (e.g., Day 1: Upper Body, Day 2: Lower Body, etc.).
- Responsive Design: The app is built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
- Interactive Tables: Each day contains a table listing exercises, including fields for sets, reps, weights, tempo, and notes.
- Simple Navigation: Easily switch between different pages (e.g., Prompt Builder and Playbook Studio).

_ Technologies Used_

- HTML: For structuring the content.
- CSS: Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic content switching.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework to speed up development and ensure a responsive design.
